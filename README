# Passenger stack, zero to hero in under five minutes
Scripts for [Sprinkle](http://github.com/crafterm/sprinkle/ "Sprinkle"), the provisioning tool

## How to get your sprinkle on:

* Get a brand spanking new slice / host (Ubuntu please)
* Create yourself a user, ssh in with password as root:
  $ adduser [user]
  $ adduser [user] admin
  $ mkdir /home/[user]/.ssh
* scp from your local machine: 
  $ ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub [user]@[ip]:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
* Set your slices url / ip address in deploy.rb (config/deploy.rb.example provided)
* Set username in config/deploy.rb if it isn't the same as your local machine (config/deploy.rb.example provided)

From your local system (from the passenger-stack directory), run:

    sprinkle -c -s config/install.rb

After you've waited for everything to run, you should have a provisioned slice.
