# Passenger stack, zero to hero in under five minutes!
Scripts for Sprinkle [1], the provisioning tool. Good introduction tutorial at [2]. Other packages at [3].

## How to get your sprinkle on:

1. Get a brand spanking new slice/host (Ubuntu please).
2. Set your slices url/IP address in deploy.rb (config/deploy.rb.example provided)
3. Set username in config/deploy.rb if it isn't the same as your local machine (config/deploy.rb.example provided)

From your local system (from the passenger-stack directory), run:

	sprinkle -c -s config/users.rb [to create users, copy ssh keys, set permissions]
  sprinkle -c -s config/install.rb

After you've waited for everything to run, you should have a provisioned slice. 

Later, to update the system, feel free to:
  sprinkle -c -s config/update.rb

# What this does not do:
* Set the password for mysql root:
 $ mysqladmin --user=root password ROOT_PASSWORD
* Set the passwords for any of the created user accounts (uses ssh key pair authentication). For prompts:
 $ passwd [user]


# How this sprinkle cloud is different from others

This one's mine! And:
* Creates users and ssh stuff automagically.
* Secures some ssh/apache stuff.
* Makes it easy to host multiple projects/apps/etc. from subdomains: by setting a domain name variable in deply
